At Heroku, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad armed with large amounts of data and spare CPU cycles. These are their stories.""
Bad behavior can wreak havoc on your web application. It might be mass-signups, fraudulent orders, spammy posts, right up to automated bots designed to work around restrictions you have set in place; this can cost you time, resources, and lots of money. All is not lost though. Despite the ongoing efforts of abusers, their activity still leaves fingerprints and clues, which you can use to your advantage.
This talk is a 101 introduction to some of the methods which you can use to separate good from bad users using a combination of data mining, statistics, and some some basic machine learning. Basically, I want to get you thinking like an internet detective.
Some of the topics I will be covering include:
As this is a 101 topic I will provide some basic examples, as well as links to more in-depth resources for further reading. I would recommend this talk to developers of web applications, especially those with a large number of users, the ability to process credit cards, or with a 'free' offering. Attendees should have a basic understanding of topics such as SQL, Pandas, and some basic understanding of mathematics and statistics, although this is not essential as I will be providing links to further reading.",ogg,English,2014-08-14 00:00:00,JSON,2014-08-11 00:00:00,Rhys Elsmore,,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VO8QxIkjqY,0.0,1.0,117.0,1.0

If that sounds like a loaded question to you: good, we're on the same page.
In this talk I will give you a full overview of one of the most powerful and headache-inducing tools in the web-developer's kit: caching.
This is a talk for all experience levels, from beginner to seriously brain-melty. The code and scenarios we'll be exploring are within the context of a Django project, but the principles are applicable to all of web development.
We'll begin our journey in the light, warm land of web browser caches: learning how you can make your users' web browsers do all the work for you. Making your site feel rocket-fast and responsive with little more than some finely crafted HTTP response headers.
From there, we'll begin our descent into the underworld of server-level caching, using reverse-proxies such as Varnish or Nginx that shield the application code from having to do any work. What they do, how they can help, and more important -- when do they not help, and when do you have to go deeper.
Finally we'll explore the dark art of application-level caching. Whether it's caching whole responses, partial responses, preventing repetitive SQL queries or expensive API response serialization calls. And, if our brains haven't exploded yet, we might throw in some asynchronous cached-view-generation  just for good measure.
Whether you're a hobbyist or a grizzled veteran, you should come out of this talk with a few new tricks up your sleeve for making all your sites do more with less work.

OpenStack is an interesting project in that it runs in a variety of different scale scenarios. There are very small deployments of only a few machines, and large public clouds with thousands of machines. The OpenStack project takes Continuous Integration (CI) very seriously, and runs a suite of unit and integration tests on all proposed patches.
One thing we weren't very good at testing though, was database upgrades. We have unit tests for many of them, but we don't know how these upgrades affect real users in the field. As a response, we worked on adding database migration testing to our CI environment. This new test infrastructure is open source (https://github.com/stackforge/turbo-hipster), and extensible. It currently runs tests on smaller databases, as well as a largish real user database. It has already caught two significant performance problems in database migrations.
This talk will cover how we built the test infrastructure (in python!). It will cover what we've learned from the 12 months of running it - time that we'll have had by the conference day. It will tell a story about some of the bugs we've found and how we fixed them.

Information from log messages and details of any Python exceptions which occurred, along with other application performance data can help to identify the issue, but not always. Often you will need to fall back to a development or test environment and hope you can replicate the problem and then debug the issue from there.
The purpose of this talk is to dive in and look at one class of tools that can be used in helping debug web applications. Specifically, it will look at web application tools such as the Django debug tool bar.
Rather than simply look at how you might use such a tool though, this talk will look at how these debug tool bars are actually implemented, how they hook into your web application, how they capture the information that they do, as well as how they can be extended to add new functionality.
The limitations on these tools as far as performance overhead, security of data etc, which nearly aways lead to them only being recommended for development environments, will also be discussed.
At the same time though, this notion that they are only suitable for development environments will also be challenged by looking at how a tool such as the New Relic Python agent, which implements application performance monitoring, overcomes such limitations to provide a production grade solution.
Are there lessons to be learnt from how the New Relic Python agent works which could drive improvements to existing web application debug tool bars? Could the New Relic Python agent itself be used as a base for a new generation of debug tool bars which combine an ability to debug a web application, even in a production environment, with the ability to monitor the performance of the web application over time?",ogg,English,2014-08-14 00:00:00,JSON,2014-08-11 00:00:00,Graham Dumpleton,,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yk5EE0Us0DE,1.0,0.0,100.0,-1.0

16,PyCon AU 2014,http://www.youtube.com/t/terms,"Pandas is increasingly becoming a standard tool in scientific computing.  Could it also have a role in the CFO's office?
CFOs regularly need to analyse the impact of different projects or business cases, and they almost universally do this using spreadsheets.  Spreadsheets have many advantages - they have a low barrier to entry and are easy for most people to understand.  However as they get more complicated, disadvantages start to appear; in particular, they can be inflexible and highly error-prone.
In this talk I will explain how business case analysis can be done using python and pandas.  The python version has several advantages over spreadsheets: it is more flexible as the business structure changes; formulas only need to be changed in a single place, reducing the chance of error; and report-ready plots are quick to produce.  I'll go through a way of structuring the problem for some simple business logic, and ways to visualise the results.
The example I’ll discuss is made more interesting and useful by being “Monte Carlo” analysis. Traditional business case analysis takes single point estimates of sales, costs and prices, and calculates a single profit forecast. Everybody knows the profit will not turn out to be exactly equal to the forecast.  But it is not clear what the range of profits might be, or how likely a loss is.  ""Monte Carlo"" analysis solves this problem by allowing ranges or distributions on the assumptions; the forecast is then a range of outcomes.
In short, I’ll demonstrate how you can use pandas to analyse high-impact business decisions, and dodge many of the problems of using spreadsheets.",ogg,English,2014-08-14 00:00:00,JSON,2014-08-11 00:00:00,Arthur Street,,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcMaO2f7ww4,0.0,2.0,165.0,2.0

While the organisation has been around for over a decade, it had a breakout year in 2013. The number of qualified instructors swelled to over 100 and collectively they ran over 100 events for over 4300 researchers in a dozen countries. To kick things off in Australia, the founder of Software Carpentry (Dr. Greg Wilson) visited Sydney and Melbourne in February 2013 to host the first ever bootcamps outside of Europe and North America.

The outcomes of these studies are only as good as the record linkage which underlies them, so the ways in which record linkage is done can have a direct impact on our ability to understand, prevent and treat serious medical conditions.",ogg,English,2014-08-14 00:00:00,JSON,2014-08-09 00:00:00,Rhydwyn Mcguire,,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEcVIjyHfiQ,1.0,2.0,158.0,1.0

38,PyCon AU 2014,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,"Come to this talk if you want to learn a few basic techniques for putting numerical data in context. If you've ever predicted anything, or tried to work out whether some number was ""good enough"", you'll probably get something out of this presentation. All techniques and tools demonstrated using Python.
Every day, decisions both big and small are made on the basis of the information published by the Bureau of Meteorology. These include simple decisions such as taking an umbrella or planning a barbecue. Our forecasts also inform Australia's emergency services on where extreme weather events may have occurred, to help with planning and preparation.
Understanding and communicating our strengths and weaknesses is very important, both as an organisation and also internally within the Environment and Research division. This presentation will focus on the statistical methods and systems used to evaluate the objective, scientific performance of our forecast systems. The name for this area of study is ""Verification"". While the concepts have come from the research environment, they are widely applicable and can help anyone who is assessing the performance of any system.
This presentation will include:
  -- An overview of the major ideas of verification
  -- How to create a 'skill score'
  -- The application of these concepts to thunderstorm forecasting
  -- How to use Python tools for verification analyses
  -- Tips on how to apply these ideas easily in other contexts
Obtaining relevant thunderstorm observational data can be particularly challenging, particularly pertaining to severe and damaging aspects: lightning, hail, heavy rain and very strong wind gusts. In order achieve a stronger footing, some new methods of analysis are under development. It is necessary to establish the scientific validity of the verification metrics at the same time as constructing the systems to support the data analysis.
A prototype web-based tool written in Python (and under active development by the presenter) will be demonstrated. This tool can run locally to provide an enhanced lab environment for assessing case study data, or be set up as a server for continuous monitoring and reporting.
No pre-existing knowledge of Python or statistics is assumed. The talk will include several technical aspects, such as working at different computing scales, usability and user experience, working with statistical algorithms, data visualisation for both web and journal publications, and the architectural challenges of a complex application.",ogg,English,2014-08-14 00:00:00,JSON,2014-08-09 00:00:00,Tennessee Leeuwenburg,,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0DE_UfRiXE,1.0,1.0,155.0,0.0

Python standard library's getopt, optparse and argparse there is a bewildering
array of packages available on the Python Packaging Index. Packages like Click,
Cliff, Docopt, Invoke all provide different mechanics for creating command line
applications. When all you want to do is expose a command line and get back to
creating functionality, it’s hard to know which alternative to reach for.
This presentation will have two parts, the first half will be a brief survey
of popular modules. Strengths, weaknesses and design philosophies will be
compared by creating command line processing for the same example program.
The second half will go into more depth on a specific package, Begins. This
package was authored by the presenter to minimise the disruption developers
experience when breaking flow to implement command line processing. The
audience will be shown how a single line of code can create a complex command
line interface. It will also be shown how a handful of decorators from the
Begins API can eliminate boilerplate code and create powerful, complex

Such versatility makes the descriptor protocol a valuable tool for any Python programmer, yet although most of us have used descriptors, fewer have implemented one.
This presentation will explain the use cases that motivate descriptors and how other features in Python fall short.  We will then look at some of the descriptors that the audience may already have used (even if they didn't know they were using descriptors!)  This will be followed with an explanation of the descriptor protocol and some implementation and usage examples.
I will discuss some of the finer details of descriptor implementation and will conclude with a look at Elk - a declarative object system authored by the presenter and inspired by Perl's Moose - and the descriptors that power it.",ogg,English,2014-08-14 00:00:00,JSON,2014-08-07 00:00:00,Fraser Tweedale,,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYBVjVEJtEg,0.0,3.0,320.0,3.0

The vast majority of Python code written in 2014 is still a SyntaxError on the latest version of Python. Some people have been wondering: will Python 3 ever take off? 
We have done some data mining from PyPI to reveal what progress the community has made so far toward migrating the long tail of packages towards Python 3 and which packages are most critical in the dependency graph of unported packages. We extrapolate from current growth rates about when (if ever) Python 3 support will reach a tipping point after which more new code will be written in Python 3 than Python 2.
We then share our perspective on mistakes made in the Python 3 transition and lessons that we can all learn from.
